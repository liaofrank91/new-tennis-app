### Tennis Tracker app that lets you add verified matches to a watchlist, search for players, and view live rankings. 

##### Covers both the ATP and WTA circuit.

##### Built with React and Firebase (used Firebase Authentication, Firestore)

**API Limitations I've noticed (using _Tennis Live Data API_ from RapidAPI):**  
- Player names with variable spelling can sometimes change. e.g. Djokovic <-> Dokovic
- Data pertaining to RACE RANKINGS (Race Rank, Race Points) are incorrect/outdated
